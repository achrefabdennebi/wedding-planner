# Wedding Planner

## Description

In the season of summer we need a time to take some rest and/or see families, also in the season there is a plenty of families that organize a weeding event for his/her children and passing all the times in calls with the agent managers for an available date to visit the wedding space and have an idea which the day will be like on the reserved date, so in this context we found many generated conflicts between clients and agent managers because it can be possible like in Tunisia my origin country to visit the space in the same day with other persons so the result will be feeling pressed or uncomfortable to check all services of the wedding space.
